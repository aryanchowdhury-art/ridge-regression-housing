# Ridge Regression for Housing Prices 🏡📊  

This project implements **Ridge Regression** to predict housing prices.  
It improves over **Linear Regression** by reducing overfitting using L2 regularization.  

## 📂 Dataset  
- Uses `housing.csv` dataset.  
- Features include `median_income`, `total_rooms`, `households`, etc.  
- Categorical feature `ocean_proximity` is one-hot encoded.  

## 🔧 Model Details  
- Implemented using **Scikit-Learn**.  
- Fine-tuned **Ridge Regression** for better performance.  
- Compared with **Linear Regression**.  
- Evaluation Metrics: `R² Score`, `MAE`, `RMSE`.  

## 🚀 How to Run  
1. Install dependencies  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
